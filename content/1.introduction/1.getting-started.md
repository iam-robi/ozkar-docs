# Introducing 0zkar

0zkar is an open-source framework under development, designed to facilitate the creation of healthcare applications on the blockchain. It employs zero knowledge proofs and privacy-enhancing technologies to enable innovative and impactful solutions. 0zkar makes the most of Mina recursive proof system to facilitate development of compliant and scalable healthcare applications on chain. 

## Goals

Some of our goals:
    - easily deploy tracable and transparent data system through Mina zkApps
    - ensure privacy in your smart contracts for healthcare
    - make the most of zk-oracle technology to integrate off-chain healthcare data into your logic
    - facilitate the development of verifiable and compliant AI in healthcare

## Components

The 0zkar tooling system will be composed of 3 components: 
- **modular typescript library** to accelerate writing of your own zkapps
- **helm chart library** to deploy open source zkoracle and zkproxy for your healthcare data
- a **cli** to facilitate interaction with 0zkar tools and data verification standards
- an [appchain](https://github.com/iam-robi/ozkar-chain) for secure traceable data exchange with advanced zk proving capabilities
